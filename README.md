### I Do not use GitHub!

This profile exists because I used to have a GitHub account, and there were commits linked to this user name.

I will only use this profile to contribute to the repositories that cannot be found elsewhere, so the only repos you can see in my account (if you see any) are ‘GitHub forks’™ for contributing...

You can find me at [codingotaku.com](https://codingotaku.com)
