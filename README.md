### I Do not use GitHub!

This profile exists because I **used to have** a GitHub account which I deleted due to reasons that you can think of (M$).  

There were commits linked to this username, and I don't want them to have a weird linking to my other profiles or be owned by someone else creating an account with this username[1].

I will only use this profile to contribute to the  repositories that cannot be found elsewhere, so **the only repos you can  see in my account (if you see any) are ‘GitHub forks’™ for  contributing**…

I find that sending patch files directly to the developer via e-mail avoids showing my contribution in my timeline but keeps it in the commit history, so that's what I will continue to do the developer does not accept patchs via email.

You can find me at [codingotaku.com](https://codingotaku.com)
