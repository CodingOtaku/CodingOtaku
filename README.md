### I Do not use GitHub!

This profile exists because I used to have a GitHub account, and there are commits linked to this profile.

I will only use this profile to contribute to the repositories that cannot be found elsewhere, so the only repos you can see in my account (if you see any) are ‘GitHub forks’™ for contributing...

You can find me at [codingotaku.com/contact-me](https://codingotaku.com/contact-me)
